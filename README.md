# OpenWee
OpenWee is an opensource device for low power wind applications with the ability to work as a wind regulator, automatic brake and also a system datalogger. The wind regulator contemplates after three phases of charging a battery, in bulk (bulk), absorption and float, allowing it to extend its useful life. The automatic brake is activated by stopping the wind turbine when a voltage above the regulation references is exceeded, working as a protection, it is also possible to activate it manually by means of a switch. Finally, the datalogger allows you to monitor different sensor variables and store them via Wi-Fi in a database in the cloud, to later be able to view them via cell phone or PC. The potential of OpenWee resides in that being opensopurce gives the possibility of adapting it depending on the application, including different sensors, also its low cost allows reaching an affordable device for rural communities that are low-income.
